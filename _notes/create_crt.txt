Test cert password: Cl1mb1ng%Turn
Challenge Password: Climbing

This is how to generate the certificates

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /home/dorothy/websites/ee4_nhspeakers.org/crt/nhspeakers.dev.key -out /home/dorothy/websites/ee4_nhspeakers.org/crt/nhspeakers.dev.crt

All my problems with using another self signed certificate came from using the wrong path.  I.e. using 
/home/dorothy/websites/ee4_nhspeakers.org/
instead of 
/media/dorothy/Data/websites/ee4_nhspeakers.org/
